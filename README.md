# Mushroom Classification with Machine Learning

## About

### Overview

This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project focused on mushroom classification. The project's primary goal is to categorize mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on various distinctive characteristics, such as cap shape, cap color, and odor. This project offers a comprehensive exploration of data preprocessing, model construction, and model evaluation, making it an ideal resource for individuals interested in machine learning and data analysis.


## Project Components

### Data

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named "mushrooms.csv." It contains a range of attributes associated with mushrooms, including their class (edible or poisonous).

### Data Preprocessing

This section provides details on the data preprocessing steps, including data type conversions, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Discover insights into the data through exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn, gaining a deeper understanding of feature relationships and their impact on the target variable.

### Model Building

This section showcases the construction and evaluation of multiple machine learning models:

- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Ensemble Model (Voting Classifier)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

### Model Evaluation

Examine model performance by comparing the accuracy of each model on a validation set to identify the top-performing model.

### Testing the Model

Apply the final model (Logistic Regression) to predict mushroom classifications on a test set and calculate its accuracy.
